// Data structures are collections of values, the relationships among them,
// and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data

// They all (data structures) excel in different situations .
// Working with map/location data? - Use a graph!
// Need an ordered list with fast inserts/removals at the beginning and end? - Use a linked list!
// Web scraping nested HTML? -  Use a tree!
// Need to write a scheduler? - Use a binary heap!

// What is a class?
// A blueprint for creating objects with pre-defined properties and methods

// THE SYNTAX
// The method to create new objects must be called constructor
// The class keyword creates a constant, so you can not redefine it. Watch out for the syntax as well!

// Classes are blueprints that when created make objects known as instances
// Classes are created with the new keyword
// The constructor function is a special function that gets run when the class is instantiated
// Instance methods can be added to classes similar to methods in objects
// Class methods can be added using the static keyword
